    <h2> 
    Hey there! I'm Omendra, a sports enthusiast and coding aficionado from Kanpur.
With a degree in hand, I've dived headfirst into the world of web development. I'm proficient in React.js, Node.js, Express, and MongoDB, and I love the challenge of bringing ideas to life through code.
When I'm not coding, you'll find me cheering on my favorite sports teams or hitting the gym. I believe in finding a balance between work and play, and I'm always up for new challenges and collaborations.

Let's connect and create something awesome together!
